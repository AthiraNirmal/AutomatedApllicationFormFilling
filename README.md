# AutomatedApllicationFormFilling

## Abstract
The project aims to automate the process of filling out job application forms using web scraping and automation techniques. The application collects data from users and then uses Selenium libraries in Python to extract job data from a CSV file and fill out the job application forms on various job websites. The program can handle text inputs, radio buttons, dropdowns, and date fields. It also ensures that all mandatory fields are filled out before moving to the next page. The project provides a faster and efficient way to apply for multiple jobs without spending hours filling out the same information repeatedly.
